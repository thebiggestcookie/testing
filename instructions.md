# Instructions for Setting Up and Running the Bulk Texting Application

1. Environment Setup:
   - Install Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager)
   - Install a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code)

2. Project Initialization:
   - Create a new Next.js project using `npx create-next-app@latest`
   - Choose the following options during setup:
     - Use TypeScript
     - Use ESLint
     - Use Tailwind CSS
     - Use `src/` directory
     - Use App Router
     - Customize the default import alias (e.g., @/*)

3. Install Dependencies:
   - Install shadcn/ui: `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`
   - Follow the prompts to set up shadcn/ui
   - Install additional required packages:
     ```
     npm install lucide-react date-fns
     ```

4. File Structure:
   - Create the following directories in your project:
     - `src/pages`
     - `src/components`
     - `src/styles`

5. Implement Components:
   - Copy the provided component files into the `src/components` directory
   - Implement any missing components mentioned in the code (e.g., DatePicker)

6. Create Pages:
   - Copy the provided page files into the `src/pages` directory
   - Ensure all imports are correct and components are properly referenced

7. Styling:
   - Update `src/styles/globals.css` to include necessary Tailwind directives
   - Add any custom styles as needed

8. Configuration:
   - Update `next.config.js` if any specific Next.js configurations are required
   - Set up any environment variables in a `.env.local` file

9. Testing:
   - Run the development server: `npm run dev`
   - Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
   - Test all pages and functionalities

10. Refinement:
    - Review the code for any missing features from the functionality list
    - Implement error handling and form validations
    - Add loading states and improve user experience

11. Backend Integration (Future Step):
    - Plan API endpoints for each functionality
    - Implement API routes in Next.js or set up a separate backend service

12. Deployment:
    - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
    - Set up deployment from your Git repository
    - Configure environment variables on the hosting platform

13. Documentation:
    - Write documentation for the project setup and any custom components
    - Document the API if you've started backend integration

14. Continuous Improvement:
    - Gather user feedback
    - Plan and implement additional features from the functionality list
    - Optimize performance and accessibility
